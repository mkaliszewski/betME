## About

**betME** is a simple betting app that allows filtering existing races by its status. When you select one of the races the bet can be placed! You can select a bet amount, race winner, 2nd place, and 3rd place. Don't forget to fill all requirements, otherwise, your bet will not be valid. And one more thing. Watch out for inactive races, you can't bet them.
